Hello! I'm so glad you're here.

For us to start getting to know each other, you have to know a few things about me: I'm Brazilian, from Rio de Janeiro. I love reading, boardgames, and games in general, even though I'm pretty bad at their digital form. My favorite tv series is Doctor Who, and I LOVE to dance, regardless the style.

As for the academic part, I work with the intersection of information, culture, and society, especially topics around memory and cultural heritage. For a long time I studied the concept of **memoricide** (and I still do), but now I'm more focused on **preservation and conservation of video games**, advised by Professor <a href="https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/david-dubin" target="_blank">David Dubin</a>. I'm fascinated by how games can be understood not just as entertainment, but as meaningful artifacts that represents artistic, technological and cultural developments of the society. But I also have interest in other topics, such as archival studies, collecting studies, media studies, and the history of Library Science, Documentation, and Information Science.

My background is originally in Library Science, though my professional experience has been quite diverse. I have worked in various types of libraries, as well as in archival settings, and even in the health area, during the pandemic.

As a careear goal, I want to contribute with innovative solutions that promote access, preservation, and the ethical use of information in cultural and technological contexts.

If you're interested in collaborating, whether in research, consulting, or project development, I'd love to connect.

Thanks for coming here!
